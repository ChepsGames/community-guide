# Info

Temp Disabled stands for Temporarily Disabled and occurs when there is an error in the servers that causes MathieuAR to make an unstable feature to get disabled

HOW TO FIX

You really can't..  You must wait for the servers to get fixed in order to regain the feature
How long will it take to fix the servers? No one knows until it is fixed.

PLEASE DON'T GO IN OUR DISCORD SERVER AND MAKE DUPLICATE POSTS ABOUT THIS ANYMORE, THANK YOU!
